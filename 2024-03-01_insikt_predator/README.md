# Predator Spyware Indicators of Compromise from Instinkt Group

This repository contains network and device indicators of compromise (IoCs) published by Recorded Futureâ€™s Insikt Group related to the IOS and Android Predator spyware tools developed by the cyber-surveillance company Intellexa (formerly Cytrox). 

The indicators were published in the following report: [Predator Spyware Operators Rebuild Multi-Tier Infrastructure to Target Mobile Devices] (https://www.recordedfuture.com/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices) report by the Recorded Future 

The STIX2 file can be used with the [Mobile Verification Toolkit](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt) to look for potential signs of compromise on Android phones and iPhones.

It includes the following files:
* `config_profiles.txt`: UUID of suspicious configuration profiles dropped by the Predator spyware
* `predator.stix2`: [STIX2](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html) file containing all indicators
* `domains.txt`: list of Predator domains
* `file_paths.txt`: file paths for Predator payloads on disk in Android and iOS.
